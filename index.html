<h2>Summary</h2>
I graduated from Northwestern University in 2003 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.  I have since worked mainly in the finance industry, writing Python and C#-based software for hedge funds and sub-prime mortgage firms.  I have developed software in many fast-paced, high-risk environments and understand the importance of writing scalable, testable, and maintainable code.

<h4>Current Role</h4>
Currently, I work as a Senior Full-Stack Developer at Abacus Group, writing internal and external-facing web applications in Python/Flask/ReactJS.  I also spend about 30% of my time managing a team of 8 Romanian outsource developers, who assist us with our legacy .NET application and our corporate Wordpress website.

<h4>Future Role(s)</h4>
I am currently looking for Full Stack Developer/DevOps roles.  I am most skilled with Python/Flask/ReactJS, but I'd be happy to discuss other opportunities.  I am excited about creating scalable applications with AWS, utilizing a RESTful microservices-based architecture.

<h4>Hobbies/Interests</h4>
Outside of the office, I play guitar and develop ecommerce sites for friends and family.  I co-founded an educational non-profit that delivers donated technology to impoverished schools around the globe.  I am also a member at a neighborhood synthetic biology lab in Oakland.
<h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>

<strong>Co-Founder / Full-Stack Developer, Abacus Group, LLC</strong>

<strong>San Francisco, California - June 2009 - Present</strong>

I co-founded Abacus with 5 other members, and began as a full-stack engineer, working closely with clients on fast-paced, mission-critical projects. My clients are typically hedge funds, so the projects are often geared towards front-office trading operations and back-office compliance operations. I have experience with Sungard's Front Arena, Bloomberg, Markit data, Risk Metrics, and Eze, and integrating those 3rd-party vendors with a Python/Django web application.

I developed a proprietary front-office trading platform, written in Django/Python that provided Profit & Loss and Risk measurements to the traders and portfolio managers. During my stay, it handled over $3 billion dollars in traded volume. I later developed a back-office Dropbox-style file syncing platform to deliver files to-and-from clients' networks to multiple broker platforms. I also managed a 10-person team in Romania, as well as continuing to develop both internal-facing and external-facing web applications, using ASP.NET MVC 5 against a SQL Server database.  We are currently transitioning this platform to Node.js/Express.

<strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong>, Round Table Investment Management</strong>

<strong>Charlotte, North Carolina - November 2007 - June 2009</strong>

I worked at Round Table as a senior software engineer, integrating 3rd party risk analysis systems (Front Arena, RiskMetrics, Markit data) for derivative instruments, and writing statistical and reconciliation tools for C-level executives in Python/Pandas, displaying results within a Django web interface.

<strong>Member, Counter Culture Labs

<strong>Team Member, Tech for Africa</strong>

    <strong>Hluhluwe, South Africa, August 2014</strong>
